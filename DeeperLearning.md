# What is this about?
I have a goal to switch careers. I have a strong background in customer service and technical support and want to transition into programming. The first step I plan to take is to move from my current role into a phone based position within a software development company (ideally a SaaS company), and from there, I will continue my efforts like this to learn programming and once I get a customer facing role, I will start volunteering for extra projects at my new job, and once I have built up enough experience, I will make the transition to actual software development. 

# What is in here?
Whenever I run across something in my work on FreeCodeCamp that I do not know about, or that they do not explain well, I dive deeper into the topic. Often I use AI to help me dive deeper. The following is my conversation on this topic. 

## Question
> I am working on the FreeCodeCamp Learn Typography by building a Nutrition Label project. On step 2, we were told
>
> Step 2
> Below your h1 element, add a p element with the text 8 servings per container.
>
> The code I entered was 
``` <p>8 servings per container</> ```
>
> It passed their check, but I realize it is wrong. It should have been 
> ```<p>8 servings per container</p>```
>
> In real life what would have happened if I would have left off the p out of the closing tag?

## Answer
> You're absolutely right to notice the mistake in omitting the closing `</p>` tag in your code for the freeCodeCamp "Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label" project. Let’s break down what happens when you leave off the closing `</p>` tag, both in the context of the freeCodeCamp environment and in a real-world web development scenario, while addressing your preference for understanding *what is happening and why*.
>
> ### What Happened in freeCodeCamp
> In the freeCodeCamp environment, your code `<p>8 servings per container</>` passed the check despite the incorrect closing tag (`</>` instead of `</p>`). This is likely because freeCodeCamp’s tests for this step are designed to check for the presence of a `<p>` element with the correct text content ("8 servings per container") and may not strictly validate the closing tag’s correctness. The testing mechanism might focus on the DOM structure or text content rather than enforcing perfect HTML syntax for this specific step. However, this leniency is specific to the learning platform and doesn’t reflect real-world browser behavior comprehensively.
>
> ### What Would Happen in Real Life
> In a real-world scenario, leaving off the proper closing tag (using `</>` instead of `</p>`) would result in invalid HTML, and the behavior would depend on how browsers handle this error. Here’s a detailed explanation of what happens and why:
>
> 1. **Invalid HTML Syntax**:
>   - The HTML specification requires that elements like `<p>` have a proper closing tag, `</p>`, to indicate where the paragraph ends. Using `</>` is not a valid closing tag for any HTML element, as it doesn’t specify which element is being closed.
>   - This makes the HTML malformed, as the browser cannot correctly interpret the intended structure of the document.
>
> 2. **Browser Error Recovery**:
>   - Modern browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) are designed to be forgiving and attempt to render malformed HTML by applying error recovery mechanisms. When a browser encounters `<p>8 servings per container</>`, it will likely:
>     - Recognize `<p>` as the start of a paragraph element.
>     - Treat `</>` as an invalid or unrecognized closing tag.
>     - Automatically close the `<p>` element implicitly before the next element or at the end of the parent container (e.g., `</body>` or another block-level element).
>   - As a result, the text "8 servings per container" would still appear as a paragraph in the rendered webpage, and the visual output might look correct despite the error.
>
> 3. **Potential Issues in Rendering**:
>   - While the browser may render the paragraph correctly in simple cases, the invalid closing tag could cause issues in more complex scenarios:
>     - **Nested Elements**: If the `<p>` element contains nested elements (e.g., `<p>Text <span>more text</span></p>`), an invalid closing tag like `</>` could disrupt the DOM structure, leading to unexpected rendering or broken layouts.
>     - **CSS Styling**: Styles applied to the `<p>` element might not work as expected if the browser’s DOM parsing is confused by the invalid tag. For example, margins, padding, or other properties might not be applied correctly.
>     - **JavaScript Interactions**: If JavaScript code relies on the DOM structure (e.g., selecting all `<p>` elements), an improperly closed tag could lead to errors or unexpected behavior, as the DOM might not reflect the intended hierarchy.
>     - **Accessibility**: Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on proper HTML structure. An invalid closing tag could confuse these tools, potentially making the content less accessible to users with disabilities.
>
> 4. **Validation and SEO**:
>   - In real-world development, HTML validation tools (like the W3C Markup Validator) would flag `</>` as an error, as it violates HTML standards. Invalid HTML can hurt your site’s search engine optimization (SEO), as search engines like Google prefer well-structured, standards-compliant code.
>   - Poorly structured HTML may also affect how crawlers interpret your content, potentially impacting indexing or ranking.
>
> 5. **Cross-Browser Inconsistencies**:
>   - Different browsers handle malformed HTML differently. While modern browsers might recover gracefully, older browsers or less forgiving rendering engines (e.g., in email clients or embedded systems) might display the content incorrectly or fail to render parts of the page.
>
> ### Why Proper Closing Tags Matter
> The `<p>` element, like most HTML elements, is a container that defines a block of content (in this case, a paragraph). The closing `</p>` tag explicitly tells the browser where the paragraph ends, ensuring the DOM is constructed correctly. Omitting or incorrectly closing the tag can lead to:
> - Ambiguity in the document structure, making it harder for browsers, developers, and tools to interpret the code.
> - Unpredictable behavior in complex layouts or when scripts and styles are applied.
> - Maintenance issues, as other developers working on the code may struggle to understand or debug malformed HTML.
>
> ### What Should You Do?
> To adhere to best practices and avoid issues:
> - Always use the correct closing tag: `<p>8 servings per container</p>`.
> - Validate your HTML using tools like the W3C Markup Validator to catch errors early.
> - Test your code across multiple browsers to ensure consistent rendering.
> - If you’re stuck on a freeCodeCamp step, double-check your syntax against the expected output, even if the test passes, to build good habits for real-world development.
>
> ### Why Did freeCodeCamp Accept the Incorrect Code?
> freeCodeCamp’s tests are designed to guide learners through incremental steps, and for Step 2, the focus is likely on ensuring you added a `<p>` element with the correct text. The test may not strictly check for the closing tag’s validity because:
> - The platform prioritizes progress over perfection in early steps to avoid overwhelming beginners.
> - The test may parse the DOM or text content rather than validating the HTML syntax strictly.
> This leniency is intentional in a learning environment but doesn’t reflect the stricter requirements of production code.
> 
> ### Summary
> In real life, using `<p>8 servings per container</>` instead of `<p>8 servings per container</p>` would result in invalid HTML, potentially causing rendering inconsistencies, styling issues, JavaScript errors, accessibility problems, or SEO penalties. Browsers would attempt to recover by implicitly closing the `<p>` element, but this is not reliable for complex pages. Always use proper closing tags to ensure robust, maintainable, and standards-compliant code. In the context of freeCodeCamp, the test passed because it likely checked for the presence of the text within a `<p>` element, not the exact syntax of the closing tag. Understanding these details helps you write better code and prepares you for real-world development challenges.

## Follow up response
> I will just assume that they were lax on their checks. What I got from that is that if I am going to write a simple HTML only page, then I might be fine with that error, but the moment I plan to make it look nice, or do something, or have someone find it, then I would run into problems. Good to know. Thank you.
